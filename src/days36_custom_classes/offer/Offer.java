    create multiple Offer objects and store them into an ArrayList of Offers. Create multiple other Lists to filter out different information:

        write a program that can remove all offers that are not for SDET or QA

        write a program that can remove the offers that are not full Time

        write a program that removes all offer that are less than 100,000 salary

        - Find the biggest and lowest salary Offers and print the whole object
