        1) initialization is executed:

           -> declaring and assigning a variable to be used in the loop. This variable that is usually used to keep track of the iterations
           -> initialization occurs once in the beginning of the loop

        2) termination condition/ boolean value is checked
                -> if the boolean is true: the code inside the loop is executed
                -> if the boolean is false: the loop stops
            i < 10;

        3) code inside the loop are executed top to bottom
             System.out.println(i);

        4) update
            the iteration of the variable executes
            i++;

        => one iteration completed

        goes back to step 2 and repeats
